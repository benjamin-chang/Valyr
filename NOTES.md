Cover: If a unit's entire body is not visible, it gains 1 dodge to any ranged attack.

Fall Damage: If a player tries to place the unit on a spot and it does not stay (without bumping or event) The unit is left on it's side and must use its next action to "stand up" it also loses all armor and dodge ratings until it stands up and cannot be considered behind cover.
